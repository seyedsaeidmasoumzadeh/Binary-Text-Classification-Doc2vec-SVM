   Gingrich sees 2-week extension of stopgap spending bill from Friday 

   The US House of Representatives will approve a two-week extension to a
   temporary spending bill from Friday if there is no agreement with
   President Bill Clinton on financing still-unfunded programs, Speaker
   Newt Gingrich said here Tuesday.

   "I think we could pass a two-week extension," Gingrich said after
   leaving a National Association of Home Builders conference.

   The House last week passed an appropriations bill that would fund the
   government for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends September 30,
   and the Senate was set to vote on a similar measure Tuesday.

   But Clinton has vowed to veto the legislation on grounds that it cuts
   too deeply into spending on education, the environment and health care
   programs.

   The current stopgap bill expires at midnight March 15 and the threat of
   a presidential veto had raised fears here of another partial shutdown
   of the federal government, similar to those of late last year and
   January.

   The money is needed for nine Cabinet departments and several other
   agencies that have so far this fiscal year been living on temporary
   appropriations.

   They have been caught in a lingering dispute between the administration
   and the Republican-controlled Congress on social spending.

   The House bill would add 3.4 billion dollars to the budget and the
   Senate measure 4.7 billion. But Clinton is demanding that eight billion
   dollars be restored in order to preserve domestic programs.

   Political analysts here had predicted that Congressional Republicans
   would avoid another showdown with the White House at the start of a
   presidential campaign and would send Clinton a straightforward bill to
   keep the agencies running for several more weeks.

   In confrontations late last year, polls made it clear that the
   electorate held Congress responsible for the deadlock.

   The temporary measure would probably allow the agencies to limp along
   under an authorization to spend no more than 75 percent of the funding
   level in fiscal 1995.
