   Scottish Football League agree to Hearts postponement 

   Hearts won their fight with the Scottish Football League on Tuesday to
   have Saturday's opening Scottish premier division match at Dunfermline
   postponed in order to recover from their European Cup Winners' Cup
   clash.

   Hearts are due to play Red Star Belgrade on Thursday with an initial
   request for the postponement turned down.

   However, Hearts won their case at a special general meeting of the
   Scottish League management committee in Glasgow on Tuesday.

   League secretary Peter Donald said: "There are no premier games on
   August 31 and if neither club has players involved in the Scotland
   World Cup squad, it may be possible to put it in there."
