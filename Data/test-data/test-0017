   Zhu Rongji Meets Czech Prime Minister (1) 

   Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, in talks with Czech Prime Minister Milos
   Zeman here today, said that Sino-Czech relations will develop even
   further in the 21st century.

   Bilateral ties should develop in a more stable and sound manner, Zhu
   stressed.

   Czech was one of the first countries to forge diplomatic relations with
   China. Noting the 50th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Czech
   diplomatic ties this year, Zhu gave credits to Czech's enormous support
   for New China and the Chinese people, which he said the Chinese
   government and the people will not forget.

   Bilateral relations have greatly developed over this period and areas
   of cooperation have ever been expanded, Zhu said. China appreciates the
   efforts made by the Czech government, led by Prime Minister Zeman, to
   promote Sino-Czech relations.

   The Chinese people greatly value the traditional friendship between
   China and Czech, and attaches importance to developing bilateral
   relations, said Zhu, adding that China respects Czech people's choice
   of their own social system and development path.

   The Premier stressed that China is fully prepared to promote Sino-Czech
   relations in the 21st century on the basis of mutual respect, equality,
   mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
