   Bosnian army Fifth Corps training reported in Bihac 

   The Bosnian army's Fifth Corps was likely responsible for the estimated
   300 detonations, gun and shellfire, heard on Friday, a UN official said
   here.

   The Bihac news agency had reported that Bosnian Serb forces fired more
   than 600 shells at mainly Moslem government forces in the former
   enclave in northwest Bosnia.

   A UN spokesman in Zagreb confirmed that more than 300 explosions were
   heard in the pocket, including just one inside the UN-declared safe
   area comprising Bihac town and its surrounding villages, early Friday.

   But a UN official in Sarajevo said that the detonations were likely
   caused by training by the Fifth Corps.

   Bihac was surrounded on all sides by besieging Croatian and Bosnian
   Serbs for over three years until early last month when the lightning
   Croatian offensive through the Krajina region opened up the pocket's
   western and northern flanks.

   Bosnian Serb forces had shelled the region Wednesday when some 600
   explosions were heard in the area, the United Nations said, including
   four in the safe area.
