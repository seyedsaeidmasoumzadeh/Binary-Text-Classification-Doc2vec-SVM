   Romanian Coalminers' Strike Declared Illegal 

   The court of Petrosani city Friday declared the coalminers' strike in
   the Jiu Valley illegal, and the miners threated to come to Bucharest
   unless their claims are met.

   Petrosani is the most important city in Romanian biggest coalfield Jiu
   Valley area, 350 km west of Bucharest.

   On January 4, at the call of their leader Miron Cozma, the miners there
   went on a general strike to protest at the government's measures for
   the restructuring of the coal mines which caused huge losses despite
   substantial state subsidies.

   The government has decided to close down the most unprofitable mines in
   the area and to lay off their employees on substantial redundancy pays
   to allow them subsistence until new jobs may be found.

   Unhappy with the proposal, the miners refused to go underground and
   sent the government a list with 30 claims, among which redundancy pay
   worth 10,000 U.S. dollars for each laid-off miner and the grant of a
   2-hectare plot of land. They also asked for the dismissal of the
   Industry and Commerce Minister.

   Negotiations between the delegation of miners, led by deputy president
   of the Miners' Trade Unions Confederation Victor Badarca and
   Governmental delegation led, on behalf of Prime Minister Radu Vasile,
   by Secretary of State in the Industry and Commerce Ministry Nicolae
   Staiculescu yielded no results.

   Interior Minister Gavril Dejeu announced that he had taken necessary
   steps to prevent the miners' travel to Bucharest.
