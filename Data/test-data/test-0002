   Costa Rica for Strengthening of Central America-EU Ties 

   Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo said today that he
   advocates a more economy-oriented relationship between Central America
   and the European Union (EU).

   Naranjo emphasized the need to bring economic issues to the forefront
   of discussion of the so-called San Jose Process, the highest forum for
   discussions of relations between Central America and the EU.

   The San Jose Process dates back to 1984 when foreign ministers from the
   two regions met for the first time in Costa Rica's capital, San Jose.

   At that time the focus was on the political crisis in Central America
   where two major armed conflicts -- one in Nicaragua and the other in El
   Salvador -- threatened to spread beyond the two nations' borders.
