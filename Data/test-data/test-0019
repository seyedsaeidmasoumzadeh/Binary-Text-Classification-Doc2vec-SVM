   Perry: NATO Ready To Help After Serb Takeover Of U.N. Enclave

   NATO ``stands ready to help'' in the aftermath of a Bosnia Serb
   takeover of the U.N.-protected enclave of Srebenica, Defense Secretary
   William Perry said today.

   Perry said NATO warplanes successfully carried out strikes today
   against Serb tanks that were threatening Dutch peacekeeping forces in
   Srebenica area.

   In brief remarks to reporters in a Pentagon hallway, Perry said it was
   too early to determine the extent of damage inflicted on the Serb
   armored forces.

   ``So far it has gone according to plan,'' Perry said. ``We were called
   upon to provide support'' for the Dutch ground troops, ``and to attack
   tanks which were threatening the Dutch troops. That mission was
   satisfactorily carried out.''

   When asked how the fall of Srebenica might affect U.S. involvement in
   Bosnia, Perry replied, ``NATO stands ready to help. We've got planes in
   the air ready to help as requested. I can't comment much beyond that
   because it is an ongoing operation.'

   On Capitol Hill today, Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint
   Chiefs of Staff, said the warplanes that led the strike against the
   Serb tanks returned safely. Shalikashvili did not disclose the
   nationality of the planes.

   But U.S. defense officials said the strike was carried out by American
   and Dutch warplanes flying out of Aviano Air Base, Italy, and off the
   U.S. carrier Theodore Roosevelt off the coast of Bosnia.

   The officials, speaking on condition they not be identified, said U.S.
   Air Force F-16 fighters and Air Force A-10 tank-killers were joined by
   Dutch planes in the air assault. Also, U.S. radar-jamming aircraft
   accompanied the attack jets, the officials said.

   Shalikashvili told lawmakers that the planes had the authority from
   both the U.N. and NATO to attack Bosnian Serb air defense sites such as
   SAM missile launchers or aircraft-detecting radar stations.

   ``For that close air support mission, NATO airplanes were allowed to
   suppress air defense sites,'' Shalikashvili said. ``In addition to that
   they had all the (defensive) aircraft with them.''

   UNPROFOR is the U.N. Protection Force in Bosnia.

   Use of the term ``close air support,'' a term that refers to air
   attacks in support of ground troops, suggests that today's assault may
   not have been simply a retaliation for previous Bosnian Serb
   provocations. It appears the strike was also an active effort by NATO
   to prevent the fall of Srebrenica, one of the so-called eastern
   enclaves in Bosnia and a U.N. ``safe area.'' The enclaves are Bosnian
   government territory surrounded by hostile Bosnian Serb forces and have
   been a flashpoint throughout the Balkan war.
