   President claims victory in Albania poll 

   President Sali Berisha announced late on Sunday that his Democratic
   Party had won legislative elections which the opposition led by the
   former communists claimed had been marred by fraud and intimidation.

   "We have won," Berisha announced to an enthusiastic crowd of more than
   6,000 supporters. Fireworks lit up the sky as the crowd chanted
   "victory, victory" and the party elite supped champagne.

   Cars draped with the DP flag drove round the city honking their horns.
   Police cars sounded their sirens and one or two celebratory shots were
   fired.

   "This is an historic day. The Albanians have finally driven out the
   communists," Berisha told AFP after the DP's main rivals the
   ex-communist Socialist Party (SP) and six other opposition parties
   pulled out of the vote to protest alleged irregularities.

   "I consider their departure as an admission of defeat. A well deserved
   defeat," the president said, adding: "The parties of the red front
   should have given up four years ago."

   The atmosphere was meanwhile subdued at the headquarters of the SP
   where around 100 of its supporters gathered earlier chanting
   "Berisha-Pinochet" - an allusion to the former hardline rightist ruler
   of Chile.

   The Socialists and four allied parties announced three hours before
   polling closed that they were withdrawing from the election because of
   alleged fraud and intimidation against their candidates.

   They demanded that the election be annulled and a new one be held in
   its place "in democratic conditions".

   Two other small opposition parties followed suit, including the Human
   Rights Party which represents the Greek minority.

   Some of the 400 international observers on hand Sunday expressed
   reservations about how the election was conducted.

   European Parliament member, Jean-Francois Vallin of the French
   Socialist Party, said he and 12 other foreign observers had witnessed
   several irregularities in the northern district of Malesia.

   "On the basis of what I and my colleagues saw, we can say that these
   elections were not genuinely fair and in France for much less than
   that, a judge would rule the outcome invalid," Vallin said.

   Observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe
   (OSCE) declined to comment on the election until Monday.

   Up to 80 percent of the 2.2 million electorate turned out to vote in
   the elections which were the third since the collapse in 1990 of
   Europe's last stalinist regime.

   In a statement, the Socialists and four allied parties accused
   Berisha's government of creating "a climate of terror, psychological
   pressure and physical violence" before and on election day.

   They said hundreds of Socialist Party members and supporters had been
   "mistreated, harassed, threatened and detained." Two were wounded by
   gunfire Sunday in the southern town of Vlora, party officials said.

   In other irregularities, opposition representatives were prevented from
   taking their seats on election monitoring panels. And ballot boxes were
   sealed with no opposition members present, Socialist spokesman Kastriot
   Islami said.

   "We will not recognize the results of this election even if the
   Socialist Party ends up winning," he said.

   After polls closed, the electoral commission put turnout at 80 percent.
   It had ordered officials at the 4,700 polling stations to stay on the
   job despite the opposition withdrawal.

   It said early results would be released overnight but no result had
   been published by 01:00 Monday (2300 GMT).

   Before the voting ended at 2000 GMT, the Democrats brandished an exit
   poll crediting them with 59 percent of the vote.

   Final results were not expected until late Monday.

   After a campaign also marked by charges of violence and intimidation,
   the election came down to a straight fight between Berisha's Democrats
   and the Socialists.

   They campaigned on similar themes, with both pledging to pursue market
   reforms, create jobs, consolidate private property and bring Albania
   into the European Union.

   The voting was marred by several incidents. In Tropoja in northwest
   Albania, a ruling party official chairing a local commission
   supervising the vote was attacked with a knife, the electoral
   commission said.

   A Socialist Party official was found with 700 fake copies of electoral
   registers in Vlora, in the south, prompting Berisha to delay the
   closing time for polling stations by two hours to allow new copies of
   registers to be distributed.

   The election was for 140 parliamentary seats, 25 of which are allocated
   on a proportional basis.
