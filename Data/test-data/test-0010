   Forest Parks Become Xinjiang's New Tourist Attraction 

   Forest parks have sprung up in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
   Autonomous Region in recent years, providing recreation for both local
   holidaymakers and travelers from afar.

   Last year five forest resorts started operation in Xinjiang, bringing
   the total number to 27 in this largest ethnic-minority autonomous
   region in the country, according to local government officials in
   charge of tourism.

   These new parks are located in the suburbs of cities, with herdsmen
   renting out their tents as hotels and restaurants.

   In 1996, some 820,000 tourists visited the parks, 200,000 more than the
   figure of the previous year. They predicted a yearly growth of 10
   percent in future, according to the officials.

   To govern the activities of tourists, local forestry authorities have
   issued a series of regulationsso as to prevent the breakout of fires
   and the accumulation of waste.

   The completion of a 520 km highway running across the desert will
   benefit the development of the forest parks as it links up many such
   parks. Moreover, this desert-borne highway has itself become a tourist
   attraction, according to the officials.
