   Landslides Cause Devastation in India's Hills 

   The recent massive landslides in India's Uttar Pradesh hills have
   caused devastation, claiming 350 lives so far in two districts and
   damaging property worth tens of millions of U.S. dollars, official
   sources said Friday.

   The main cause of the landslides, the worst recorded in the northern
   Indian state, was the result of blunt deforestation and rapid
   development of the region, the sources said.

   On the nights of August 18-19, the Malpa village and Ukhimuth township
   experienced massive rains followed by heavy landslides, which have
   virtually washed away the entire village, where at least 60 pilgrims
   were camping.

   The death toll was around 200 in the village excluding the 60 pilgrims.
   The army, paramilitary forces and the Indian Air Force with the help of
   local police have recovered only 32 bodies.

   A search is going on for the rest of the bodies but reports said it is
   almost impossible to recover more bodies because most of them are
   buried under 21 meter high muddy debris.

   The death toll in Ukhimuth might be about 125, but only 32 bodies have
   been recovered.
