   Actor Carroll O'Connor Blames Drugs For Son's Suicide 

   Hours after Carroll O'Connor's son committed suicide, police arrested
   the man whom the actor accused of selling drugs to his son.

   Harry Thomas Perzigian was booked for investigation of cocaine
   possession Wednesday, the day after Hugh Edward O'Connor shot himself
   to death. The booking charge was changed to possession for sale after
   police seized what appeared to be more than an ounce of cocaine, along
   with drug paraphernalia and dlrs 1,700 cash, police said.

   ``We located some cocaine in a toilet that apparently was attempted to
   be flushed by him,'' said Lt. Bernie Larralde.

   Perzigian, 39, posted dlrs 15,000 bail Wednesday afternoon.

   O'Connor, 32, who appeared on his father's TV show ``In The Heat of the
   Night,'' killed himself with a gunshot to the head Tuesday night.
   Afterward, his father tearfully told reporters that Perzigian supplied
   drugs to his only child.

   ``These dealers, they kill people,'' O'Connor said outside his son's
   home in Pacific Palisades. ``They make a living giving people the means
   to kill themselves. Harry, I want to see you someday.''

   The 71-year-old actor best known for playing the bigoted working-class
   Archie Bunker in ``All In The Family'' had called police earlier
   Tuesday, saying his son was despondent and had access to guns.

   A crisis negotiator and special weapons team were dispatched to the
   son's home, but the younger O'Connor told them to go away and he shot
   himself. Police said they found a suicide note.

   Hugh O'Connor's death came on his third wedding anniversary. Besides
   his father, he is survived by his wife, Angela Clayton; their
   2-year-old son, Sean; and his mother, O'Connor's wife, Nancy.

   O'Connor said he wondered whether it wouldn't be better to legalize
   drugs. ``It's not going to create more addicts,'' he said. ``It's just
   going to put the crooks and criminals and killers out of business.''

   Hugh O'Connor played Lt. Lonnie Jamison on the CBS series ``In the Heat
   of the Night,'' which stars his father as a Mississippi sheriff.

   A funeral was scheduled in Los Angeles on Saturday, but the rites will
   be private.
