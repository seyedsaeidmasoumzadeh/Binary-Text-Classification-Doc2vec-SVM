   Japan Foresees Sustainable Growth in Asia-Pacific 

   The Asian-Pacific economies will achieve sustained growth in the long
   run despite a minor economic slowdown in 1996, Japan's Economic
   Planning Agency predicted today.

   "It is still difficult to see any limit on growth for these economies,"
   the organization said in a 350-page report on 16 economies in Eastern
   and Southern Asia and Oceania.

   The report said the region's growth last year slowed by 0.8 points,
   from 8.2 percent in 1995 to 7.4 percent, largely due to plunging
   exports resulting from the semi-conductor price dive.

   However, there were no substantial obstacles lying ahead in the
   region's growth, said the report, which examined the economies'
   potential in mobilizing labor, raising capital and improving
   technology.

   It estimated a considerable extra labor force of 470 million in rural
   areas of China, Indonesia, newly industrialized economies and other
   southeastern Asian countries.

   Ample bank deposits in the region, and growing saving rates, would
   guarantee the capital needed for development, the report said.

   It said the region's technology acquisition from Europe and the United
   States was gaining momentum, which ensured efficiency rises, a key
   element in achieving long-term growth.

   The surveyed economies were China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
   Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam,
   India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand.
