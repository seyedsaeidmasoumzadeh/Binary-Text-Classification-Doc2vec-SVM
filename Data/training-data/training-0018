   Oil drilling in Soyo could resume in four months 

   Oil drilling in Soyo, in northern Angola, the country's second largest
   field after Cabinda, could resume in four months, an expert with the
   national oil company Sonangol said.

   The installations at Soyo were largely destroyed during fighting
   between the UNITA armed opposition forces and government troops.

   Regular troops took control of the town at the end of October.

   An expert at the Angolan oil ministry estimated the cost of
   reconstruction at 200 million dollars.

   Before the installations were destroyed, Elf-Aquitaine of France,
   Fina-petrole of Belgium and Texaco of the United States all operated in
   Soyo.
