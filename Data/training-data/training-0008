   Five die in blast at illegal fireworks factory 

   An explosion at an illegal fireworks factory in central China has
   killed at least five people and caused the collapse of several
   surrounding buildings, state media said Monday.

   The explosion occurred early Saturday morning in the basement of a home
   in Wen county, in the central province of Henan, the China News Service
   said.

   Police were investigating the cause of the blast, it said.

   The explosion turned the home in Guangzhuang village into rubble and
   caused the collapse of five surrounding homes. The entire area was
   littered with paper used to wrap firecrackers, the report said.

   China is the world's biggest producer of fireworks, with people in
   rural China often illegally producing them in their homes under unsafe
   conditions.

   Figures for those killed annually in firework production accidents are
   not released, but are thought to be high.

   A year ago, at least 42 children were killed in an explosion at a
   village school in south China's Jiangxi province which had forced
   students to make firecrackers.
