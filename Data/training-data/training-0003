   Saudi man suffocates in bid for freedom 

   An elderly Saudi suffocated to death as he tried to escape from the
   Gulf kingdom to Egypt in a steel container on board an Egyptian ship,
   the government daily Al-Ahram said Sunday.

   Officers at the Egyptian port of Suez discovered the man's decomposing
   body in the chest on board the Al-Arish ship which set off from Jeddah
   in Saudi Arabia.

   The man, who was in his 80s, had been locked in the 75-centimetre high
   container by a friend in a bid to escape from the Saudi authorities,
   Al-Ahram said.

   He had with him a hammer and special steel-cutters as well as a
   ventilator, a bag of apples and water, but luggage piled on top of the
   chest prevented him from getting out once the boat had set off.
