   Japan's vice health minister resigns over gift-taking scandal 

   The top bureaucrat of Japan's health and welfare ministry resigned
   Tuesday, a day after the newspapers accused him of receiving certain
   favours from the head of a group operating nursing homes.

   Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi told a news conference
   early Tuesday that he had accepted the resignation of vice minister
   Nobuharu Okamitsu, the top bureaucrat in the ministry.

   The resignation came hours after Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
   expressed anger over his admission that he had received certain favours
   from Hiroshi Koyama, 51, who was arrested Monday over a separate
   bribery case.
