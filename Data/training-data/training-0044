   China Able to Mass Propagate Rainbow Trout Fries 

   Chinese scientists in the Aquatic Products Administration of Qinghai
   Province, northwest China, has succeeded in mass propagating rainbow
   trout fries after eight years of painstaking efforts.

   According to local sources, the survival rate of rainbow trout fries in
   the Aquatic Products Administration has reached 85.6 percent.

   China started breeding rainbow trouts in the late 1980s in Qinghai and
   Gansu provinces, both of which have a vast area of cold water. However,
   the survival rate was very low.

   Beginning from 1990, Qinghai Province, taking the opportunity of
   implementing a UN-aided fishery development project, organized
   scientists and technicians to carry out researches on mass propagation
   of rainbow trout fries. They have increased the survival rate by
   adjusting the fodder, among other measures.

   The propagation center of rainbow trout fries at the Nanmen Gorge in
   Qinghai has bred 1.1 million head of baby rainbow trouts this year,
   with an average weight of one gram per head, said a local experts.

   Now, Qinghai can mass propagate rainbow trout fries since it has built
   several industrialized propagation centers and fodder-processing
   plants.
