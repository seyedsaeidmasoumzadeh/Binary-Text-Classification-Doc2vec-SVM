   Ruble Finally Slips Against Dollar, Ending Six-Day Rise 

   Russia's resurgent ruble slipped against the dollar Wednesday,
   interrupting a rare rise that had persisted for six days.

   The dollar gained 12 points to close at 5,038 rubles on the Moscow
   Interbank Currency Exchange, up from 5,026 on Tuesday.

   Since bottoming out at 5,130 to the dollar on April 29, the
   long-sliding ruble had gained 2 percent in value in a six-day surge.

   Though that spurt ended Wednesday, economists and analysts say the
   ruble appears to be on course toward more stability because of falling
   inflation and a recent tightening of requirments on bank reseves.
