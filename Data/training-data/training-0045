   No Interim Goverment Plan in Pakistan 

   There is no plan to bring in a new set-up like interim political or
   national government under a new prime minister in Pakistan.

   This was said by Major General Rashid Qureshi, Press Secretary to the
   President and Director General of Inter Services Public Relations, here
   on Sunday.

   "There is no such a plan and there has been no contemplation on the
   lines of interim government or appointing a prime minister," Qureshi
   told local journalists.

   He said the government has given a roadmap for restoration of democracy
   and holding of elections and steps are being taken for implementation
   of this roadmap.
