   Chissano Urges Churches to Step up Dialog 

   Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano has urged the churches to step up
   dialog so that people can respect each other and social morals be
   reestablished.

   Chissano made the remarks at Chicumbane county, Gaza province Sunday at
   a ceremony to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the autonomy of the
   Presbytery in Mozambique.

   He said the churches have carried out many activities in the country,
   playing vital role in all fields, especially in education and medicine,
   in reestablishing social morals and bringing harmony to the families.

   Chissano spoke highly of the role the Presbytery played in protecting
   Mozambicans from being slaughtered during the colonial era.

   There are three million Moslems and nearly four million Catholics in
   Mozambique's more than 15 million population.
