   UK Scientists Call for Wildlife Health Monitoring Scheme 

   British scientists have called for establishing a wildlife health
   monitoring scheme, saying that there is a clear need for a national
   scheme to check the health of the country's wild creatures.

   The call for such a national wildlife monitoring scheme is published in
   the Veterinary Record, the journal of the British Veterinary
   Association.

   The scientists say the present approach is fragmented, and probably
   misses many animal diseases, thus constituting a threat to the welfare
   and conservation of wild species. It may also jeopardize the welfare of
   domestic animals, and even human health.

   The scientists are from the Zoological Society of London's Institute of
   Zoology, and the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.
