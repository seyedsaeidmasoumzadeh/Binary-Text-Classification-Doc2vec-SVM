   French foreign minister meets Algerian president

   French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette pledged to try to boost
   relations between Paris and Algiers after a meeting here Thursday with
   Algerian President Liamine Zeroual.

   After an hour-long meeting that looked at the full gamut of bilateral
   links, he said France was ready "to take a new lead in Franco-Algerian
   relations."

   De Charette's two-day visit to Algeria, which began Wednesday, is the
   first by a French minister to its former colony in three years.

   The new start was based on the principles of "mutual respect and a
   common interest in jointly resolving questions that affect both
   countries," he said.

   Algeria has been wracked by civil war in which more than 50,000 people
   have died since the government annulled elections in January 1992 which
   the Islamic opposition was poised to win.

   The decision to cancel the elections was criticised by France at the
   time, and the violence that followed has frequently spilled over into
   France with a spate of bomb attacks, including a terror campaign last
   summer in which eight people were killed and more than 100 wounded.

   Speaking on France 2 television, De Charette said both countries had
   agreed to step up their dialogue in every aspect.

   However, although he passed on a message of goodwill from French
   President Jacques Chirac, he said there had been no discussion of
   whether Chirac himself would visit Algeria.

   A meeting between Chirac and Zeroual last October was cancelled at the
   last minute, and Algiers later accused Paris of meddling in its
   internal affairs.

   De Charette said he had also meet French religious leaders in Algeria,
   for talks centred on the assassination by Islamic fundamentalists of
   seven French Trappist monks in May.
