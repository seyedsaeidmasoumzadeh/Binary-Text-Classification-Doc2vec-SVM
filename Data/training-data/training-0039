   Sri Lankan Schools Close Indefinitely 

   The Sri Lankan government ordered all schools on the island to be
   closed today for an indefinite period because of tension between the
   government and rebel troops.

   Education Ministry sources said that the order was made at the requests
   of the parents worried about the security of their children.

   The northern Tamil rebels who blew up two oil installations in Colombo
   on October 21 have threatened to blow up schools in the south in
   retaliation to the government thrust into their stronghold in the
   Jaffna peninsula.

   With the closure of schools, public examinations scheduled for the year
   end are postponed.
