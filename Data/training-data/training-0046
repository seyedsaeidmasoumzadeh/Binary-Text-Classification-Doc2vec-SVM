   the session, gave non-members five minutes to leave the secretairat to
   begin a five-day summit to discuss, among other things, the
   seven-year-old war in liberia, local press reported today.

   ECOWAS heads of state and government at the end of the recent summit in
   Abuja had requested that a meeting of the committee of nine should be
   convened by the new chairman not later than August 18 to consider the
   various issues on the Liberian peace process as contained in the Abuja
   agreement.

   The eighth meeting of foreign ministers of the committee is scheduled
   to open today, while officials of the committee of nine will meet
   tomorrow, reports said.

   The ECOWAS heads of state are expected to appraise the report of the
   committee on Saturday.

   Meanwhile, a Liberian organisation, the South-Eastern Youth Movement
   for National Unity (SEYMNU), on tuesday presented a paper on the
   resolution of the Liberian civil war to the meeting of the committee of
   nine. The paper stressed the need to disarm among various Liberian
   factions in order to put an end to the gruesome and inhumane activities
   In the Liberian society.

   '' The leadership in Liberia must not be reduced to the status of being
   auctioned to the most gruesome, insensate and inhuman faction,'' Seymnu
   warned.

   According to the organisation, leadership ''must be determined by the
   ballot box not by the barrel of the gun.''
