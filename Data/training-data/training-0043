   Indian PM gets new ally 

   A key regional party pledged support Monday for India's coalition
   government on the eve of a parliamentary motion to censure the
   administration for its handling of sectarian riots in Gujarat state.

   Mayawati (eds: one name) said her BSP party, which has 13 MPs in the
   federal parliament, would back the coalition government of Prime
   Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.

   Mayawati's support came after a deal struck with Vajpyee's Hindu
   nationalist BJP party which agreed to support her claim to form a
   government in the politically crucial northern state of Uttar Pradesh.

   Minutes after announcing her support for the government, Mayawati went
   to the residence of the Uttar Pradesh governor to formally press her
   claim.

   Elections in February had left the state legislature deeply fractured,
   with no single party capable of forming a viable administration.

   While the BSP will support Vajpayee's administration, Mayawati stressed
   it would not join the Vajpayee cabinet.

   "In the next parliamentary elections too, we will have an alliance with
   the BJP," she added.

   The BSP's support in Tuesday's censure debate became crucial for the
   government after several key coalition allies indicated they might vote
   with the opposition.
