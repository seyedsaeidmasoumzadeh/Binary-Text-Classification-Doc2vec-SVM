   Palestinians protest Jewish settlements 

   About 500 Palestinians protested Monday in the Dheisheh refugee camp
   near Bethlehem against Israeli plans to expand Jewish settlements in
   the West Bank, sources said.

   The protesters, who burned an Israeli flag and waved the Iraqi and
   Lebanese flags, also demonstrated against attempts by Jewish settlers
   to destroy a monument commemorating Palestinians from Dheisheh killed
   by Israeli soldiers, the Palestinian sources added.

   No incidents were reported with Palestinian police or the Israeli
   soldiers stationed outside the refugee camp.

   The Israeli military approved on Thursday the construction of 2,000
   more homes for Jewish settlers on the West Bank.

   The new right-wing government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
   Netanyahu decided in July to lift the freeze on expanding settlements.
