   Dispute Continues Over Montenegro's Presidential Candidacy 

   The dispute over who should represent the ruling party in the
   presidential election in Yugoslavia's republic of Montenegro has
   developed into a veto game between federal and regional authorities.

   The election is scheduled for October 5, but the leadership of the
   republic's ruling Socialist Democratic Party has been deeply divided
   over who should be nominated to represent the party in the election.

   While one faction nominated the incumbent President Momir Bulatovic,
   the other preferred the current Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic.

   As the republic's election law allows only one candidate for one party,
   its Constitutional Court ruled on August 14 that Bulatovic's candidacy
   be disqualified.

   But the federal Constitutional Court overruled the regional court on
   August 27, insisting that Bulatovic's candidacy be reinstated. The
   federal institution also threatened to determine if the republic's "one
   candidate for one party" legal provision is constitutional.

   However, the republic's National Assembly ruled this evening that the
   ruling of the federal constitutional court has no legal force and the
   federal institution has no right to determine whether the republic's
   legal provision concerning presidential candidacy is constitutional.
