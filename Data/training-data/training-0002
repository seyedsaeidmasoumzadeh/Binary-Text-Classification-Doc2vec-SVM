   NZ Government Signs Land Deal with Maoris 

   The New Zealand government and Maoris in the Waikato region in central
   North Island signed today a land deal which is recognized by both sides
   as "full and final."

   The deal was signed by Prime Minister Jim Bolger and Maori Queen Dame
   te Atairangikaahu in Ngaruawahia, about 550 KM north of Wellington.

   The deal involves a government apology and redress worth 170 million NZ
   dollars (110.5 million US dollars) including cash and land.

   The government will return 14,000 hectares of land to the Maoris in the
   next five years, in most cases excluding all buildings.

   In 1863, the then NZ authorities confiscated over 480,000 hectares of
   land belonging to the Tainui tribe. Later, only about 25 percent of the
   land was granted back and a small amount of compensation paid.
